### Editor Comments 

Nicole T: Lookie what we have here! Who were you trying to impress Bash? What's her name????

Carlos Lopes: You got me on twitch and Twitter but you choose to invade this? You have a separate page for your VO work. Professionalism Nikki.
I forgot some TNC members use this for side projects.

Nicole T: Awww OK! Whoever she is. I hope she realises. You know, You're just amazing! Go get her tiger. 
ROAR! Leanna says you only listen to Shania when you're in love üòÇ you would know if you read her book
Honestly, you're in two chapters. C'Mon Carlos! 
It made some people cry it was that good.

Nicole T: Oh before I forget Boo Boo, Bianca is working on a DMW story telling project
I saw the draft on your Wild Card Match With NDT Where it was a 2V2
The insults Carlos. The insults! If you don't remember:

When Andy said "this is no place for a lady"
You said "Then why are you in the vicinity?" ü§£ü§£

The referee gave you a warning but then Immediately followed up with:

"Hey Andy, I see that even when a pawn becomes a queen
Your still just a playing piece" ü§≠üòÇüòÇ

You're so lucky you were not DQ. Anyway looking 
Forward to seeing it when it's done. 

Carlos Lopes: Feels like so long ago. sounds good I'll keep an eye out for it
Btw, retire this page i have no use for it anymore. Thanks for letting me use it! I saw some interesting project titles but I'll resist the urge to check it. 

Nicole T: Sure thing Boo. 

Carlos Lopes: Not your Boo! But you are my favourite VO Actress!
Are CC Going to hire you for future games or can't you say?

Nicole T: Aww Fanks!! My lips are sealed, but swing by stream later I'll give you a special shout out.

Carlos Lopes: I'll have to pass but I'll be sure to check out the VOD

Nicole T: OKEH! Catch you later Bash. 

Carlos Lopes: It's alright, you go on ahead. I'm not gonna die on you, 
and leave you in a cold, cruel, Carlos-less world."

Nicole T: "Ok" üòÅ

**As one of the core on site medical personnel, What do you love most about the DMW?**

Everyone has a Story in their own right, The competitors, even the Tournaments history over the years, it has been a privilege for me to be a part of. There are always some contestants that catch the eye due to their presence and personality, you just cannot help but take an interest. I'm grateful to have such a wonderful team around me. 

**Care to name a few?**

Leanna‚Äôs History with the tournament is one that you cannot ignore, Nicole with her contribution and near misses, But for me Carlos Is someone like I‚Äôve never seen. So focused and determined to win. And yet enjoy each moment for what it is. Very similar to Lea, in terms of playstyle he is so much more aggressive. Lea‚Äôs book makes for more interesting I assure you. If you have not read it already.

**Yes! Loved it, read it twice. You were assigned to Carlos Lopes, what was that like?

For a charming and well-mannered man it was An absolute nightmare! I will never forget when I first met him, as standard procedure we run check ups on each competitor, he came into the room, I explained who I was and what we‚Äôll be doing. When it came to a blood pressure test he pulled out his arm before I could strap it in and he started singing Sledgehammer by Fifth Harmony.

The Quarter finals was a test for me as he clearly was suffering from fatigue and lack of mental awareness, Thank God the committee gave him some time to rest, it was not looking good at some point, the human body simply cannot sustain long hours of concentration without having a break. That is where he is reckless. He did not care much for his own health. The willingness to keep pushing was keeping him going. He Knew there was a strong chance he would meet Lea in the final, it was what he and the rest of Tantalus wanted. Put me through my paces and I was not even taking part!


**If there ought to be another event, would you voulenteer again? And who would you liked to be assigned to?

Absolutely! If my schedule permits. We try to remain impartial. But I would not mind being assigned to Carlos again. Normal just isn‚Äôt in his vocabulary.
