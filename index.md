Nicole T: Lookie what we have here! Who were you trying to impress Bash? What's her name????

Carlos Lopes: You got me on twitch and Twitter but you choose to invade this? You have a separate page for your VO work. Professionalism Nikki.
I forgot some TNC members use this for side projects.

Nicole T: Awww OK! Whoever she is. I hope she realises. You know, You're just amazing! Go get her tiger. 
ROAR! Leanna says you only listen to Shania when you're in love üòÇ you would know if you read her book
Honestly, you're in two chapters. C'Mon Carlos! 
It made some people cry it was that good.

Nicole T: Oh before I forget Boo Boo, Bianca is working on a DMW story telling project
I saw the draft on your Wild Card Match With NDT Where it was a 2V2
The insults Carlos. The insults! If you don't remember:

When Andy said "this is no place for a lady"
You said "Then why are you in the vicinity?" ü§£ü§£

The referee gave you a warning but then Immediately followed up with:

"Hey Andy, I see that even when a pawn becomes a queen
Your still just a playing piece" ü§≠üòÇüòÇ

You're so lucky you were not DQ. Anyway looking 
Forward to seeing it when it's done. 

Carlos Lopes: Feels like so long ago. sounds good I'll keep an eye out for it
Btw, retire this page i have no use for it anymore. Thanks for letting me use it! I saw some interesting project titles but I'll resist the urge to check it. 

Nicole T: Sure thing Boo. 

Carlos Lopes: Not your Boo! But you are my favourite VO Actress!

### ü¶ã Interview with Bianca Williams ü¶ã - Interviewer: Kate Miller 
 
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81630632/116121593-ab1e1200-a6b8-11eb-8881-6844d7360f02.png)


**Hello Bianca! Can I just say that you're one of my favourite people! How did your role come about?**

BW: Awww Thanks Kate! Well, I initially started out as a contestant. However, after being knocked out in the preliminaries I was around when there were a few concerns with the well being of other entrees, one thing led to another and the committee asked how I felt about becoming a medic on site, one thing lead to another and the rest is history as they say. üòä

**You have been Instrumental with the changes and procedures over the years, what do the Tournament entrees typically go through before it starts?**

BW: Thanks Kate! There is a mandatory process that each entree has to go through before they can start. It invovles Standard checks such as blood pressure, Reaction tests, an IQ test, also taking medical history into account. That's the jist of it without going into much detail. 

**As one of the core on site Doctors, What do you love most about the DMW Bianca?**

BW: Everyone has a Story in their own right, The competitors, even the Tournaments history over the years, it has been a privilege for me to be a part of. There are always some contestants that catch the eye due to their presence and personality, you just cannot help but take an interest. I'm grateful to have such a wonderful team around me. I love everything about it. 

**Care to name a few that has caught your eye?**

BW: Leanna‚Äôs History with the tournament is one that you cannot ignore, Nicole with her contribution and near misses, But for me Carlos Is someone like I‚Äôve never seen. So focused and determined to win. And yet enjoy each moment for what it is. Very similar to Lea, but in terms of playstyle he is so much more aggressive. Lea‚Äôs book makes for more interesting reading I assure you. If you have not read it already.

**Yes! Loved it, read it twice. Let's talk about Carlos Lopes, our charismatic Champion, Were you assigned to him? Or was it a choice that was made early on?**

BW: For a charming and well-mannered man it was An absolute nightmare! I will never forget when I first met him, as standard procedure we run check ups on each competitor, he came into the room, I explained who I was and what we‚Äôll be doing. When it came to a blood pressure test he pulled out his arm before I could strap it in and he started singing Sledgehammer by Fifth Harmony. I was not best pleased! Before I knew it, my colleagues were signing it. It was quite the scene, I knew there and then that he would not make things easy for me. I remember wanting to recommend him to the nearest psychatic ward I thought he was that crazy. I'm not joking, not even a little!

I made a concious decision early to become his onsite Medic, after he told me that he did not sleep well the night before, I had an incline I had to keep one eye on him. Ordinarily this is not an issue. However, due to the Tournament structure, Wild card entrees could potentially spend the best part of 72 hours in a constant match after match scenario without much rest if any! In my experience, Wild card entrees do not stick around for long due to the demand of having one match after another, this was an issue waiting to happen at some point, and it did.

**If you go into detail for us, what exactly happened just before the round of the last 16, Handicap match, and Quarter finals?**

BW: Certainly, I think it was right after the 2 v 2 scenario where he helped Nicole see off Andre and Angela, he came to see me. barely able to stand, holding his dead and complaining about dizziness and lack of vision. All signs of Transient fatigue since he was in excellent health with no prior medical issues. I helped him sit down in the chair. However, he was intent on sitting on the carpet with his back to the wall. I crouched down beside him and explained if he does not stop now he will risk suffering a relapse with lack of rest, with the chance of being taken to hospital with a IV attatched. But he laughed!! Stating that he isn't done yet. I had it set in my mind that I was going to contact the committee, and to forfeit him so he can recover. There is only so much a medic can do here. I was about to walk away to inform the powers that be, but he strongly stated that I should ignore my duties since this is what he wants no matter the cost before falling asleep. I had a chat with the comitee and we decided that after 40 mins if he is unable to continue based on my diagnosis we'll have no choice but to "declare him unable to continue"

I went back to the room and watched over him, after 20 odd mins he woke up, again, I crouched down beside him and checked him over. This time he pulled me down beside him and I landed in his arms and he stated "Is this a better view?" again voicing my displeasure. It sounds forceful. But to be fair he didn't use that much strength.  However, he did say that If was uncomfortable I was free to get up. He seemed Clam, relaxed, fresh like a daisy! So there I was, in his arms just chatting about life and my interests. I felt the closer I could get, the better I could examine him, it seemed to put him at ease and I started to get less nervious. 

The fatigue seemed gone, his awareness was back. Thank God the committee gave him some time to rest, it was not looking good at some point, the human body simply cannot sustain long hours of concentration without having a break. That is where he is reckless. Despite at times pleading with him to just stop for his own good. However, given the conditions that he was competing in, he did not have much of a choice, but I got the sense he enjoyed it when things were more difficult. He did not care much for his own health. The willingness to keep pushing was keeping him going. He Knew there was a strong chance he would meet Lea in the final, it was what he and the rest of Tantalus wanted. Put me through my paces and I was not even taking part! He stood up, helped me up and left for his next match. I made sure to observe him throughout the rest of it

**Your favourite DMW Moment?**

BW: Oh gosh there have been a fair few! It must be when Carlos And Lea made the final their own. Two individuals on top of their game, striving for the same result. Their history, mutual understanding and respect for each other could be felt throughout the entire building. I remember Lea taking off her wedding ring and placing it on the table, while Carlos took off his cross and made a heart shape around it. A Prefect symbolic touch by both of them, one where words were not needed. The only thing that mattered was their match. What a Spectacle It was. This was their moment, and nobody was going to take it away from them.

**In his victory speech the first thing he did was thank you for looking after him. Called you a "Royal Physician" Is that where you got your nickname?** 

BW: In the grand scheme of things, we are not as actively involved since we operate behind the scenes as you know. I do remember crying just a little! It felt like I was there with him the whole time throughout his journey. More overjoyed at the fact that he managed to win the tournament. Yes, ever since then that nickname just stuck with me. One I feel that I don't deserve, I am thankful for the thought. Everyone around here just calls me Doc. Something he coulden't bring himself to do. I think that nickname is either reserved for someone else or he just preferred calling me RP.

He is Cleary a showman, just fun to watch and be around, how he was able to peform on a consistant basis time after time is beyond me. When Nicole told me to look out for him, I had no idea how things were going to turn out. He has a rascal about him no doubt about that. It's easy to give the wrong impression sometimes. To win the love from the crowd, the officals is some feat. He loved picking his battles with the committee. But It's all good fun!

**I heard Carlos Took you out to celebrate one evening, this true?**

BW: He Sure did! Took me out for a wonderful evening, He also bought me flowers, some chocolates and a gift. Even took me dancing one time since I did not believe him when he said he could Dance. You can say he made up for all the stress he caused me haha! There are some people that just suck you in with their infectious personality, and he is one of them. I really had alot of fun. üòä 

**Ok Bianca. I feel there is something you're not saying here! Describe your relationship with Carlos in one word?**

Platonic! üòä 

**We love it! If there ought to be another event, would you voulenteer again? And who would you liked to be assigned to?**

BW: Absolutely! If my schedule permits. We try to remain impartial of course. I'm really just glad to be able to help people. We got to make sure that the committee doesn't do anything lavish and remain grounded üòâ

**Thank you for the chat and insight Bianca! Hopefully the next tournament venue and date is announced soon. Would also like to take a moment to Wish Carlos Happy Birthday!! From myself and the rest of the team! We know you hate it, but we don't forget! If someone can kindly tell Carlos to CHECK HIS EMAILS please! We would like to arrange an interview here! Footage from the tournament will be added to the video section shortly! Watch this space. Thank you and goodbye**

BW: Thanks for having me, HAPPY BIRTHDAY CARLOS!! You'll hear from me later. Hugs and kisses.
