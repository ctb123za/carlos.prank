### Editor Comments 

Nicole T: Lookie what we have here! Who were you trying to impress Bash? What's her name????

Carlos Lopes: You got me on twitch and Twitter but you choose to invade this? You have a separate page for your VO work. Professionalism Nikki.
I forgot some TNC members use this for side projects.

Nicole T: Awww OK! Whoever she is. I hope she realises. You know, You're just amazing! Go get her tiger. 
ROAR! Leanna says you only listen to Shania when you're in love üòÇ you would know if you read her book
Honestly, you're in two chapters. C'Mon Carlos! 
It made some people cry it was that good.

Nicole T: Oh before I forget Boo Boo, Bianca is working on a DMW story telling project
I saw the draft on your Wild Card Match With NDT Where it was a 2V2
The insults Carlos. The insults! If you don't remember:

When Andy said "this is no place for a lady"
You said "Then why are you in the vicinity?" ü§£ü§£

The referee gave you a warning but then Immediately followed up with:

"Hey Andy, I see that even when a pawn becomes a queen
Your still just a playing piece" ü§≠üòÇüòÇ

You're so lucky you were not DQ. Anyway looking 
Forward to seeing it when it's done. 

Carlos Lopes: Feels like so long ago. sounds good I'll keep an eye out for it
Btw, retire this page i have no use for it anymore. Thanks for letting me use it! I saw some interesting project titles but I'll resist the urge to check it. 

Nicole T: Sure thing Boo. 

Carlos Lopes: Not your Boo! But you are my favourite VO Actress!
Are CC Going to hire you for future games or can't you say?

Nicole T: Aww Fanks!! My lips are sealed, but swing by stream later I'll give you a special shout out.

Carlos Lopes: I'll have to pass but I'll be sure to check out the VOD

Nicole T: OKEH! Catch you later Bash. 

Carlos Lopes: It's alright, you go on ahead. I'm not gonna die on you, 
and leave you in a cold, cruel, Carlos-less world."

Nicole T: "Ok" üòÅ

### ü¶ã Interview with Bianca Williams ü¶ã  


 
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81630632/116121593-ab1e1200-a6b8-11eb-8881-6844d7360f02.png)


**Hello Bianca! Can I just say that you're one of my favourite people! How did your role come about?**

BW: Awww Thanks Kate! Well, I initially started out as a contestant. However, after being knocked out in the preliminaries when the DMW tradition began, I was around when there were a few concerns with the well being of other contestants. Since It can potentially go on for long hours at a time, one thing led to another and the committee asked how I felt about becoming an on site doctor, and the rest is history as they say. üòä

**You have been Instrumental with the changes and procedures over the years, what do the Tournament entries typically go through before it starts?**

BW: You're being too kind! Thanks Kate! There is a mandatory process that each contestant has to go through before they can start. It invovles Standard checks such as blood pressure, Reaction tests, an IQ test, also taking medical history into account. That's the jist of it without going into much detail. 

**As one of the core on site Doctors, What do you love most about the DMW Bianca?**

BW: Everyone has a Story in their own right, The competitors, even the Tournaments history over the years, it has been a privilege for me to be a part of. There are always some contestants that catch the eye due to their presence and personality, you just cannot help but take an interest. I'm grateful to have such a wonderful team around me. I love everything about it. 

**Care to name a few entries that has caught your eye?**

BW: Leanna‚Äôs History with the tournament is one that you cannot ignore, Nicole with her contribution and near misses, But for me Carlos Is someone like I‚Äôve never seen. So focused and determined to win. And yet enjoy each moment for what it is. Here is a guy who has never entered before, and goes on to take first place in his maiden appearance. It's unheard of, It does not happen. Especially with Wild Card Entries. He is Very similar to Lea with their approach. But in terms of playstyle he is so much more aggressive. Lea loves a chat during a match, where Carlos tends not to say much unless he is spoken to. Lea‚Äôs book makes for more interesting reading I assure you. If you have not read it already.

   *Carlos Lopes & Lea Burger in thier respective shots. They would go on to face each other in the final.
   Tantalus 2nd Generation. #6 and #2 respectively. Best Of The Best*

**Yes! Loved it, read it twice. Let's talk about Carlos Lopes, our charismatic Champion, Were you assigned to him? Or was it a choice that was made early on?**

BW: For a charming and well-mannered man it was An absolute nightmare! I will never forget when I first met him, as standard procedure we run check ups on each competitor, he came into the room, I explained who I was and what we‚Äôll be doing. When it came to a blood pressure test he pulled out his arm before I could strap it in and he started singing Sledgehammer by Fifth Harmony. I was not best pleased! Before I knew it, my colleagues were signing it. It was quite the scene, I knew there and then that he would not make things easy for me. I remember wanting to recommend him to the nearest Psychiatric ward! I thought he was that crazy. I'm not joking, not even a little!

Most Contestants that do the initial tests do not wish to know their score. Carlos did very well in all aspects. Reaction time was the best out of everyone, as well as scoring highly on his IQ test. I won't reveal what the score was. In terms of the tournament itself this does not really mean much. But good to know!

I made a concious decision early to become his onsite Medic, after he told me that he did not sleep well the night before, I had an incline I had to keep one eye on him. Although when I would ask him how he was feeling from time to time, he would change the topic. Ordinarily this is not an issue. However, due to the Tournament structure, Wild card entries could potentially spend the best part of 48 hours in a constant match after match scenario without much rest if any! In my experience, Wild card entries do not stick around for long due to the demand of having one match after another, this was an issue waiting to happen at some point, and it did.

**If you could go into detail for us, what exactly happened just before the round of the last 16, Handicap match, and Quarter finals. There was some delay without ever an explanation being given? Everyone left was present besides from Carlos for the best part of an hour**

BW: Certainly, I think it was right after the 2 v 2 scenario where he helped Nicole see off Andre and Angela, he came to see me. barely able to stand, holding his head and complaining about dizziness and Blurred vision. The tournament evolves mainly around your ability to think and act, making fast decisions, It can be quite strenuous. it appeared as if he did not know where he was, It's amazing how he was able to consciously find me while in that state. All signs of Transient fatigue since he was in excellent health with no prior medical issues. I helped him sit down in the chair. However, he was intent on sitting on the carpet with his back to the wall. I crouched down beside him and explained if he does not stop now he will risk suffering a relapse with lack of rest, with the chance of being taken to hospital with an IV attatched. But he laughed at that!! Stating that he isn't done yet. I had it set in my mind that I was going to contact the committee, and to advise them to default him so he can recover. There is only so much a medic can do here. I was about to walk away to inform the powers that be, but he strongly stated that I should ignore my duties since this is what he wants no matter the cost before falling asleep. I had a chat with the comitee and we decided that after 40 mins if he is unable to continue based on my diagnosis we'll have no choice but to declare him unable to continue, That was all the time I was able to buy him. No wild card entry has ever made it this far, and this is why.

I went back to the room and watched over him, after 20 odd mins he woke up. Again, I crouched down beside him and checked him over. This time he pulled me down beside him and I landed in his arms and he asked "Is this a better view?" We both smiled and laughed, he was back to his usual self! Hooray! He did say that If was uncomfortable I was free to get up. Well, you did force me into your arms Carlos, without my consent. But Thanks for giving me the option to pull away. üòÉ He seemed Calm, relaxed, fresh like a daisy! So there I was, in his arms just chatting about life and my interests. it seemed to put him at ease and I started to feel less anxious. It was a nice moment between us. He started signing another song, the baywatch theme this time! haha! But you know what the funny thing is, the lyrics make sense! I had to google it to be sure! Everyone reacts differently, having some rest did him a world of good!

In a flash it seemed that the fatigue was gone, his awareness was back. After doing some checks. Thank God the committee gave him some time to rest, it was not looking good at one point, the human body simply cannot sustain long hours of concentration without having a break. That is where he is reckless. Despite at times pleading with him to just stop for his own good. However, given the conditions that he was competing in, he did not have much of a choice, but I got the sense he enjoyed it when things were more difficult. He did not care much for his own health, the end goal was his only focus, the will power of certain individuals is truly amazing. The willingness to keep pushing was keeping him going. He Knew there was a strong chance he would meet Lea in the final, it was what he and the rest of Tantalus wanted. Put me through my paces and I was not even taking part! I remember when He stood up and helped me up, he placed each hand on my shoulders, looked me right in the eye and thanked me for looking out for him, for the first time, there was a sincerity about how he conducted himself, I can't put it into words Kate, it was a look of a man that was ready to win. I started to understand him better while observing him more. He is someone that needs to express himself, won't be bogged down, and does not shy away from confrontation. As we would find out subsequently through the rounds. I guess he was feeling good since he moon walked off the stage after his next match!

**Wow! Your favourite DMW Moment? Or Quote?**

BW: Oh gosh there have been a fair few! I absolutely love the Sledging aspect of it, When comments and little jibes are made. Carlos seemed to always have a come back ready when provoked, the pawn becoming a queen insult, and asking Andre why he is in the vicinity if a lady should not be present made me chuckle! Unofficially of course! üòâ It must be when Carlos And Lea made the final their own. Two individuals on top of their game, striving for the same result. Their history, mutual understanding and respect for each other could be felt throughout the entire building. I remember Lea taking off her wedding ring and placing it on the table, while Carlos took off his cross and made a heart shape around it. A Prefect symbolic touch by both of them, one where words were not needed. The only thing that mattered was their match. They both sat there almost as if they have done it many times before. What a Spectacle It was. This was their moment, and nobody was going to take it away from them.

**In his victory speech the first thing he did was thank you for looking after him. Called you a "Royal Physician" Is that where you got your nickname?** 

BW: In the grand scheme of things, we are not as actively involved since we operate behind the scenes as you know. I do remember crying just a little! It felt like I was there with him the whole time throughout his journey. More overjoyed at the fact that he managed to win the tournament. Yes, ever since then that nickname just stuck with me. One I feel that I don't deserve, I am thankful for the thought. Everyone around here just calls me Doc. Something he coulden't bring himself to do. I think that nickname is either reserved for someone else or he just preferred calling me RP.

He is Cleary a showman, just fun to watch and be around, how he was able to perform on a consistant basis, time after time is beyond me. The committee did him a solid by giving everyone a break. It's easy to give the wrong impression sometimes which is something he did with the committee, regardless of nearly being eliminated by poor officiating, It all evened out in the end. When Nicole told me to look out for him, I had no idea how things were going to turn out. He has a rascal about him no doubt about that. He is magnanimous. Got to love the passion To win the love from the crowd and the officals (most) is some feat. He loved picking his battles with the committee. But It's all good fun!

*Art By: JenVonJen - A vist to the Royal Physician is all you need. She loves her Pot Plants*

**I heard Carlos Took you out to celebrate one evening, this true?**

BW: He Sure did! Took me out for a wonderful evening, He also bought me flowers, some chocolates and a gift. Even took me dancing one time since I did not believe him when he said he could Dance. You can say he made up for all the stress he caused me haha! There are some people that just suck you in with their infectious personality, and he is one of them. I really had alot of fun. üòä 

**Ok Bianca. I feel there is something you're not saying here! Describe your relationship with Carlos in one word?**

BW:Platonic! üòä 

**We love it! If there ought to be another event, would you voulenteer again? And who would you liked to be assigned to?**

BW: Absolutely! If my schedule permits. We try to remain impartial of course. I'm really just glad to be able to help people. We got to make sure that the committee doesn't do anything lavish and remain grounded üòâ

**Thank you for the chat and insight Bianca! Hopefully the next tournament venue and date is announced soon. Would also like to take a moment to Wish Carlos Happy Birthday!! From myself and the rest of the team! We know you hate it, but we don't forget! If someone can kindly tell Carlos to CHECK HIS EMAILS please! We would like to arrange an interview here! Footage from the tournament will be added to the video section shortly! Watch this space. Thank you and goodbye!**

BW: Thanks for having me, HAPPY BIRTHDAY CARLOS!!!!!!

Heya Guys N Girls! 

I thought I'd share this Story with the Tournament just round the corner, I'll leave the player analysis To Sophie Who does a fabulous Job As always! 

I'll try to be brief!

So our very own Carlos "Bashful" Lopes came around to discuss potential issues with his participation due to his Passport having expired. As we have not yet been formally introduced, It was a good time to catch up with the man that Arianne, Nicole, and Lea speaks so highly about. I was feeling under the weather. When I do not have breakfast I tend to get cranky as most of you know! Long story short, I realy wanted my buttered bread, Eggs, and Coffee! And I like it in a specific way. Of course he likes a challenge. So he offers to do it in under 5 mins. While singing Pat Benatar - Heartbreaker. Switching certain lyrics for eggs and toast! üòÅ 

To my suprise instead of asking for a spatula to flip the eggs, he asked for a spoon. I threatened to withdraw his application if he messes it up, but that only made him smile. After a few tosses of the bread and eggs, it was ready! I did notice that he likes to flick things with his wrist while with precision! As if he was going too fast and had to slow down by tapping his shoulder. We've all seen it. But this time it was with breakfast. Very Entertaining! But only one question remained. Why A spoon?

He said: 


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81630632/145247947-1579ee2e-d563-48bb-90ad-caf7082b1de8.png)


And that was my introduciton to Carlos, never before have I signed off an application so fast in my life. I lost track of time but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I started to understand that he does like to challenge himself by making things harder......Using a spoon to make eggs though?! With the yolk intact? But How? absurd! ü§≠ Delicious breakfast though! Defo made me a fan! Carlos will be my pick.

See you guys soon.

==============================


===================























ZM: I had just sprained my ankle after having a mishap, I could still move. However, It was super uncomfortable! I've not Met Carlos offically at this point, besides from the odd hello and how are you's. Some guys can be overzealous, Since Carlos is known for being aggressive in a competiive enviroment I was cautious. To reiterate, I was a little scared yes! It was a fun moment üòÉ

Anyway, so he spots I'm in some discomfort and offers to give me a hand. Nicole still has the video since she was filming something else at the time and then this happened...And No! Nobody is ever to view that video....Ever! üòÉ

**Special Thanks To Nicole Du Toit for the transcript**

CL: "You look like you could use a hand. Grab on, I'll carry you over"

Zoe: "No Thanks, It's not far"

At this point he proceeds to carry me, leaving me no option really. 

CL: "You know Zoe, you're heavier than you look!"

ZM: "None of that please! I did not ask for an escort!"

CL: "Are you always this sassy? I'll roll out the red carpet but it has teeth! Besides you have trouble walking. We're halfway there"

ZM: "Put me down this instant before you do something silly!"

Carlos: "Sure I'll put you down, you'll probably be fine if you land on your butt anyway"

ZM:"I beg your pardon?"

CL: "hahaha! You want me to say it? Fine, yeah you have a nice behind happy now?"

ZM: "Thanks But, I mean, This isn't helping any!"

CL: "Are you having fun yet? Houston, you are clear for landing in 3....2.....1!"

ZM: "oh my God. Somebody help me!"

CL: "Hi! I'm Someone! And I'm helping you Zoe, Relax. here we made it, Precious cargo still in tact, Satisfied?"

ZM: "Actually, You missed the Mark!" 

CL: "You're welcome! You and your attitude can take the last few steps. Thank you for choosing Carlos Airlines, we hope you enjoyed your flight! hahahaha! Later Zoe.


### üëæ Amanda.M - Potential Exciting Gaming News!! üëæ

If you're a 80's/90's Kid you'll surley recongise the picture below. It will star a few household names within our community. 

According to one source *Cough Cough* Suzy.S.H! Our very own Resident Evil Charmer, Carlos L. Will take up the leading role having displayed impressive raw voice over talent in October/Dec doing a recording session in London last year. With another sheduled in the coming two months with the talented Nicole T. Seems as though those two cannot be seperated at the moment! Sonny.B also set to feature. 

We can't say much at this time, fingers crossed the hurdles are overcome for this to become a reality. Chances are likely that it will become a fan made project rather than an actual release due to liscening issues. It's still in the super early stages. However, we're excited either way! 

Have you figured out what it is yet? üòâ

Stay Safe.
Stay Brave.
